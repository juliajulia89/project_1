How does it work?
The game screen is a interface where treasures and mermaids will be displayed. The player can move in all directions. The player got 20 seconds to get from start to finish, otherwise the game is over. The player wins if he manages to cross in less than 20 seconds and doesnt get stung by a mermaid.
